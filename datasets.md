Here you will find a collection of datasets available on the public domain for various tasks.
I strive to make the data I use for my research open. In case anything is not working please contact me at [papachristoumarios@cs.cornell.edu](mailto:papachristoumarios@cs.cornell.edu).

### Social Networks 

#### Opinion Dynamics

Data in this category consist of unweighted directed networks where each node has a multi-dimenaional label (0-1 valued) regarding whether (or not) each node endorses a certain opinion. The file `X.edges` contains directed edges between the nodes of the network, and the file `X.feat` contains a dense feature matrix where the first entry corresponds to the corresponding node id.

* [pokec](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mYF3E5adntiTbwb4EWp4SrAhYMD9yPMU/view?usp=sharing). Derived from [soc-pokec](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-pokec.html). The data contains users of the pokec social network where users with private information have been filtered out. The attributes of each user are derived by looking at his/her corresponding profile interests (described in the original network).
* [github](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tqP-1uJvmKq96XsGmXCKTaHZV-FXs5i2/view?usp=sharing). Contains data gathered from [GHTorrent](https://ghtorrent.org) where nodes are github projects and attributes are programming languages that the corresponding project contains.
