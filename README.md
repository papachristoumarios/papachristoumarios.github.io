This is my personal homepage built with Jekyll and the Lanyon Theme. 

In case you want to use the original theme, please refer to its official page since this is a customized derivative of it.

You will need `jekyll` to run the webpage on your machine. After installing `jekyll` via
```bash
gem install jekyll
```
you can run the jekyll webserver via
```bash
bundler exec jekyll serve
```
