Here you can have a look at my past and current projects

### Autogyro Control for the CanSat Competition

Develop an autogyro control system for the descent of a payload as part of the CanSat Competition, organized by NASA and the American Astronautical Society as part of the [White Noise](https://whitenoise.gr) Team, winning the 4th position, out of 93 teams. 

My responsibilities included the descent control system design which controlled the payload through control fins. I used optimal control for the control of the system and clustering for inverting the fin model used for simulation. The control software can be found [here](https://github.com/white-noise-ntua/autogyro-control) and the rest of the code for the mission [here](https://github.com/white-noise-ntua). 

### SADE

_August 2018 - May 2019_

This project aims to provide software clusterings using vector semantics and the call graph. The results were published at ESEC/FSE 2019 and can be found [here](https://github.com/papachristoumarios/software-clusterings-with-vector-semantics-and-call-graph/raw/master/manuscript.pdf).

### 3gm – Google Summer of Code

_May 2018 - August 2018 (Summer internship)_

This project aims to provide an automated codex of with the most recent versions of each law in Greek Legislation via NLP methods and practices.

Results are published at [3gm.ellak.gr](https://3gm.ellak.gr)

Technologies Used: Python, gensim, spaCy, numpy, sklearn, flask, bash, MongoDB

### Ratle

_November 2017 - October 2018 (start-up)_

I am co-founder and software engineer of a [fintech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology) startup called Ratle. We have implemented a fully-working and automated contactless transaction system that aims to eliminate the need of the cashiers and the struggle of time-consuming waiting queues. At the time being, the payment is done automatically based on indoor positioning done with beacons which that track the products you want to buy. Our website is at [www.ratle-labs.com](http://www.ratle-labs.com). [Test on real (pilot) store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XemEQaNxL3Q&feature=youtu.be). The project was suspended due to increased academic load.

Technologies Used: Typescript, HTML, CSS, Google Firebase, Beacons, Time-varying denoising techniques

### TEDx NTUA Website

_October 2017 - April 2018_

Responsible for website development (developed in Laravel PHP framework) and technical support.You can find more at [2018.tedxntua.com/en](https://2018.tedxntua.com/en)

Technologies Used: PHP, Laravel, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, MySQL

### SignGlove

_March 2016 (Hackathon Contest)_

SignGlove is a gesture glove targeted for people with disabilities. It features a sign langage translator glove capable of
transforming sign language to speakable words which was built during ECESCON 9 Hackathon. Repository hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/papachristoumarios/SignGlove)

Technologies Used: Python Android Scripting Layer, Kivy, NumPy, ctypes, C++

### TritonFPR

_July 2014-August 2014 (Research Project at Hellenic Centre for Marine Research)_

Triton FPR is a Fish Pattern Recognition Project which aims to identify captured species and provide the users and
researchers with the proper information. The user captures a photo of the desired specimen and requests identification.
Then, the computer attempts identification by looking at a pre-generated database being acquired during previous research
activities on already acquainted species. Finally, it performs morphometric analysis on the selected specimen. Repository hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/papachristoumarios/triton-fpr)


Technologies Used: Python, NumPy, OpenCV

### LEGO 3D Printing-Milling Machine

_Approx. 2010 (Freelance Project)_

This is a project in which a special (reverse-engineered) RepRap 3D printer and milling machine. Using LEGO as modular
components make the machine is made hybrid with the capability of placing a specialized extruder instead of the milling
bit. This project also led to a paper publication at Elsevier’s Telematics & Informatics Journal at age 16 (see [1]). Repository hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/papachristoumarios/lego-mindstorms-3d-printing-milling-machine) and legacy repo at [Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/lego-mindstorms-3d-printing-machine/)

Technologies Used: Java, LeJOS NXJ
