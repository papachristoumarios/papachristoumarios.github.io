# Past & Current Projects

## 3gm – Google Summer of Code

May 2018 - August 2018 (Summer internship)

This project aims to provide an automated codex of with the most recent versions of each law in Greek Legislation via
NLP methods and practices.

Results are published at [3gm.ellak.gr](https://3gm.ellak.gr)

Technologies Used: Python, gensim, spaCy, numpy, sklearn, flask, bash

## Ratle

_November 2017 - present (start-up)_

I am co-founder and software engineer of a [fintech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology) startup called Ratle. We have implemented a fully-working and automated contactless transaction system that aims to eliminate the need of the cashiers and the struggle of time-consuming waiting queues. At the time being, the payment is done automatically based on indoor positioning done with beacons which that track the products you want to buy. Our website is at [www.ratle-labs.com](http://www.ratle-labs.com).

Technologies Used: Typescript, HTML, CSS, Google Firebase, Beacons, Time-varying denoising techniques

## SignGlove

_March 2016 (Hackathon Contest)_

SignGlove is a gesture glove targeted for people with disabilities. It features a sign langage translator glove capable of
transforming sign language to speakable words which was built during ECESCON 9 Hackathon. Repository hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/papachristoumarios/SignGlove)

Technologies Used: Python Android Scripting Layer, Kivy, NumPy, ctypes, C++

## TritonFPR

_July 2014-August 2014 (Research Project at Hellenic Centre for Marine Research)_

Triton FPR is a Fish Pattern Recognition Project which aims to identify captured species and provide the users and
researchers with the proper information. The user captures a photo of the desired specimen and requests identification.
Then, the computer attempts identification by looking at a pre-generated database being acquired during previous research
activities on already acquainted species. Finally, it performs morphometric analysis on the selected specimen. Repository hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/papachristoumarios/triton-fpr)


Technologies Used: Python, NumPy, OpenCV

LEGO 3D Printing-Milling Machine

Approx. 2010 (Freelance Project)

This is a project in which a special (reverse-engineered) RepRap 3D printer and milling machine. Using LEGO as modular
components make the machine is made hybrid with the capability of placing a specialized extruder instead of the milling
bit. This project also led to a paper publication at Elsevier’s Telematics & Informatics Journal at age 16 (see [1]). Repository hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/papachristoumarios/lego-mindstorms-3d-printing-milling-machine) and legacy repo at [Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/lego-mindstorms-3d-printing-machine/)

Technologies Used: Java, LeJOS NXJ
