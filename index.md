I am a first-year PhD student in the _Computer Science Department_ at _Cornell University_, advised by Prof. [Jon Kleinberg](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/). I received my undergraduate degree from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens in July 2020 where I completed my Thesis under the supervision of Prof. [Dimitris Fotakis](https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/). I have also been a researcher for the [Business Analytics Lab (BALab)](https://www.balab.aueb.gr), supervised by Prof. [Diomidis Spinellis](https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/). My primary research interests lie within the field of _Data Science_ where I want to bridge theory and application in order to tackle many interesting problems.

My work is accessible via the following _profiles_
