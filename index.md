I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the _Computer Science Department_ at _Cornell University_; extremely fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jon Kleinberg](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/). I am interested in the _theoretical_ and _applied_ aspects of _information networks_. More specifically, I have worked on problems regarding [statistical network models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94105-8), [hypergraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00783), and contagion in [financial](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3485447.3512047) and [supply chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12660) networks. 

In the summer of 2023, I will intern at the [Office of Applied Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/office-of-applied-research/) in Microsoft Research. During my Ph.D., I interned at the User Modeling Research Team at [Twitter Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com), where I worked on scalable methods for node classification. I have also contributed to the open-source [GeomScale](https://geomscale.github.io) organization and the [volesti](https://github.com/GeomScale/volesti) package. 

My research is supported by a [LinkedIn Ph.D. Fellowship](https://cis.cornell.edu/inaugural-grants-announced-strategic-partnership-linkedin), a grant from the [A.G. Leventis Foundation](https://www.leventisfoundation.org/), a grant from the Gerondelis Foundation, and was supported in the past by a [Cornell University Fellowship](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/financial-support/fellowships/new-student-fellowships/).

I received my undergraduate degree from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens in July 2020, where I completed my thesis at the [Computation And Reasoning Laboratory (CoReLab)](https://corelab.ntua.gr) under the supervision of Prof. [Dimitris Fotakis](https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/). I have also been a researcher for the [Business Analytics Lab (BALab)](https://www.balab.aueb.gr) at the Department of Management Science and Technology at the Athens University of Economics and Bussiness, supervised by Prof. [Diomidis Spinellis](https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/) working on applications of machine learning and networks on the topic of software architecture recovery.
