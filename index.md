## Short Bio

I am a Senior Undergraduate Student at National Technical University of Athens. I am currently doing my undergraduate thesis on Machine Learning under the supervision of Prof. [Dimitris Fotakis](https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/).

I am also a researcher at [Business Analytics Lab (BALab)](https://www.balab.aueb.gr), supervised by Prof. [Diomidis Spinellis](https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/).

My research interests include Machine Learning (specializing in Graphs), Software Engineering and Algorithms.
