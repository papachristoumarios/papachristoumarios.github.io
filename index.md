I am a graduate of the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ntua/gr) of the National Technical University of Athens. I completed my Thesis under the supervision of Prof. [Dimitris Fotakis](https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/). I am also a researcher at [Business Analytics Lab (BALab)](https://www.balab.aueb.gr), supervised by Prof. [Diomidis Spinellis](https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/). Starting from Fall 2020, I will be joining the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University as a Ph.D. student. My research interests include Machine Learning (specializing in Graphs), Software Engineering and Algorithms. I have previously interned at Google Summer of Code developing a [project](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-3gm) for the [automation of codification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law)) of Greek Legislation under [3gm.ellak.gr](https://3gm.ellak.gr/).
