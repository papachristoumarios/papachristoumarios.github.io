\section{Currently \\ working on}
\field{Google Summer of Code 2019} {\emph{Feb. 2019--(exp. Sept. 2019)}}
Mentor previously curated project. More details can be found at \url{https://goo.gl/p4tCpn}

\field{CanSat USA Engineering Competition} {\emph{Oct. 2018--(exp. June 2019)}}
Member of White Noise space engineering team. Responsible for the development of control systems of an aytogyro payload for the CanSat USA Engineering Competition organized by the American Astronautical Society. 

\field{Software Architecture Recovery with Machine Learning} {\emph{Aug. 2018--}}
Conduct research on software architecture recovery using Machine Learning. 
    

\section{Professional \\ Experience}
\field{Google Summer of Code (Summer Internship)}  {\emph{April 2018-September 2018}}
Developed a fully functional tool for automated codification of Greek Legislation using Natural Languaging Processing Methods and Practices. See the project section for more information. Mentored by Prof. Diomidis Spinellis. 

\section{Selected \\ Projects} 

\field{3gm -- Google Summer of Code} {\emph{May 2018 -- }}
This project aims to provide an automated codex of with the most recent versions of each law in Greek Legislation via NLP methods and practices. Results are published at \url{3gm.ellak.gr}. \\ Repository: \url{https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-3gm}

\field{Ratle} {\emph{November 2017 -- October 2018}}
I was co-founder and software engineer of a fintech startup called Ratle. We had implemented a fully-working and automated contactless transaction system (\url{https://goo.gl/UymCdN}) that aims to eliminate the need of the cashiers and the struggle of time-consuming waiting queues. The activity of the startup is currently paused due to heavy school load. There are
no plans for restarting in the foreseeable future.

\field{SignGlove} {\emph{March 2016 (Hackathon Contest)}}
SignGlove is a gesture glove targeted for people with disabilities. It features a sign langage translator glove capable of transforming sign language to speakable words which was built during ECESCON 9 Hackathon. \\ Repository: \url{https://github.com/papachristoumarios/SignGlove}

\field{TritonFPR} {\emph{July 2014-August 2014 (Research Project at Hellenic Centre for Marine Research)}}
Triton FPR is a Fish Pattern Recognition Project which aims to identify captured species and provide the users and researchers with the proper information. The user captures a photo of the desired specimen and requests identification. Then, the computer attempts identification by looking at a pre-generated database being acquired during previous research activities on already acquainted species. Finally, it performs morphometric analysis on the selected specimen. It was developed using Python, NumPy and OpenCV \\ Repository: \url{https://github.com/papachristoumarios/triton-fpr}

\field{LEGO 3D Printing-Milling Machine} {\emph{Approx. 2010 (Freelance Project)}}
This is a project in which a special (reverse-engineered) RepRap 3D printer and milling machine. Using LEGO as modular components make the machine is made hybrid with the capability of placing a specialized extruder instead of the milling bit. This project also led to a paper publication at Elsevierâ€™s Telematics \& Informatics Journal at age 16 (see [1]). \\ Repository:  \url{https://goo.gl/rdzkkM}
